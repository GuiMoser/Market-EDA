# Market EDA

This notebook performs an exploratory data analysis on five datasets from a supermarket.

To do this it uses python and its libraries pandas, numpy and matplotlib, after the merge and clean the data and remove inconsistent values, we can see the costumer prefferences like which day of the week people shop, how many people place orders at each hour of the day and how long people wait before placing another order. And to analyze the items we can see which are the 20 most popular products, which are the top 20 items that people put in their carts before everyone else.
