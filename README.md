# Market EDA

## Project Description
This notebook performs an exploratory data analysis on five datasets from a supermarket.

To do this it uses python and its libraries pandas, numpy and matplotlib, after the merge and clean the data and remove inconsistent values, we can see the costumer prefferences like which day of the week people shop, how many people place orders at each hour of the day and how long people wait before placing another order. And to analyze the items we can see which are the 20 most popular products, which are the top 20 items that people put in their carts before everyone else.

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis.
- Group customers based on their purchase data.
- Analyze the best-selling products and the day of the week with the most sales.

## Tools and Libs used
- Python: Main language used for analysis.
- Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib e Seaborn: Libraries for creating graphics.

## Learnings
- Data analysis: interpreting and extracting valuable insights from large volumes of data.
- Data cleaning: identifying and correcting missing, duplicate, and anomalous values.
- Creating graphics: using matplotlib and seaborn to visualize data in an intuitive and informative way.
- Use of libraries and tools: practical application of various libraries and tools from the Python ecosystem, such as Pandas, Numpy Matplotlib and Seaborn.
